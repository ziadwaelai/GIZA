There are no seasonality components detected in the numerical predictors. the numerical predictors also exhibit skewness values ranging from 0.06039959715116834 to 2.0726671116471223, and kurtosis values of 0.26071817135428565 to 6.187667160104816. The fractal dimension analysis yields values ranging from -0.7691742480129325 to -0.07206732166549693 indicating a Complex and irregular time-series structure for the numerical predictors. The correlation values among the numerical predictors have a minimum of -0.286465899226552, maximum 1.0, mean 0.2632250120998471, and standard deviation 0.4307490205356671. Among the categorical predictors, the count of symbols ranges from 60 to 70 with a minimum entropy value 0.5949441372813379, maximum entropy 5.38012706586354, mean 4.066286463074365, and standard deviation 2.0074418160658984. The dataset is converted into a simple regression task by extracting the previously described features.",RandomForestRegressor,"{'max_depth': 20, 'n_estimators': 250, 'random_state': 42}"
